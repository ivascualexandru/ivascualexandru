- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ivascualexandru
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about programming languages, as programming (and taking a closer look at how every piece of code works) is my passion.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to do exactly that, by being a student at university. As such, this github will sometimes go through periods of inactivity.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me by email at alexandru.ivascu247@gmail.com, and by phone at 0040744547087 (WhatsApp included).
